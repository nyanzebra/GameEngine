# GameEngine

Background
=============

This project is meant to explore the creation of game engine from bottom up. The goal is to create all necessary components to build a fully functional game in 2d and 3d.

Overview
===========
  1. Graphics: The graphics portion of this project will initially utilize the OpenGL library and later, hopefully, include DirectX compatibility. 
  2. Physics: The physics portion of this project will built from scratch, and may eventually include physics past motion.
  3. Test: The project will be tested thoroughly on multiple levels to assure quality (unit, integration, acceptance)
  4. Tools: This portion includes useful tools* for other portions e.g.(math, console, test framework, ...)
  5. Compiler: Similar to Torque3d, there may later be a custom language built-in to facilitate development
  6. Interface: Multiple interfaces that may be composed into an IDE?
